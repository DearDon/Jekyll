### Abstract: 
 
Main page for recording learning sklearn from [sklearn web](http://scikit-learn.org/stable).
It include many machine learning algorithm/application, both supervised or unsupervised learning, such as classification, regression, clustering, etc. Enjoy it!<br> 
 
### Content:
We can roughly separate those traditional machine learning algorithms(excluding deep learning) into **supervised** or **unsupervised** learning algorithm based on if input data with/without *labels*.
 
#### 1. Supervised learning
**Supervised** learning algorithm refer to learning algorithm request input data *with label*, by which the input is *well label* for the attribute we're intrested in. And we usually want to know the *same attribute/label* for other external data without such label by learning on labeled data.
##### 1.1. Classification
##### 1.2. Regression

#### 2. Unsupervised learning
**Unsupoervised** learning algorithm, on the other hand, refer to learning algorithm requested input data *without label*. The input data is *unlabeled*. We can't neither are intrested in the such label. Instead, we intend to find some rules or infomation in these data, try to cluster or transfer them.
##### 2.1. Clustering 
* [**kmeans**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/DearDon/Sklearn/blob/master/Clustering/kmeans.ipynb) is a unsupervised machine learning algorithm. It intend to separate unlabeled data to several *clusters* based on their *feature*. It's intention is kind of like classification.

 
### History: 
 
* <em>2017-08-13</em>: create post for demonstration of k-means assumption 
* <em>2018-04-05</em>: reorgnised page without transfer notebook to markdown, and post-create main page for skilearn package.
