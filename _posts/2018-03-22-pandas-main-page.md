#### **Abstract:** 
 
Main page for recording learning pandas based on book "Python for Data Analysis" by Wes McKinney and his example codes from [repos](https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book).
This book introduced basic ipython tool, bases numpy and then pandas. It shows a easy way to process 2-ndarray as a df. The example notebook include my own notes when learning or test. Enjoy it!<br>
